# Capstone-Project-Analysis

Project Objective: This final capstone project was assigned as a final project assignment to complete University of Chicago's Fullstack Academy Data Analytics Bootcamp program. We were assigned the task to choose a data topic of our choice and complete the full data analysis from there. The data was exported directly from Divvy's website and the City of Chicago's data portal. They were then brought in to Excel and Python to complete the data cleaning, formatting and initial exploratory analysis. I used Tableau to complete the visualizations and create the final presentations.

This project was completed by topics learned in the University of Chicago's Fullstack Academy Data Analytics Bootcamp course. I used Excel, Python and Tableau to complete my analysis.
